		<h4>Tom Middleton - Managing Director</h4>

		<p>
			I have loved every minute of my career in estate agency, starting in the late 90s I have seen many different
			housing market conditions over the last two decades. I have experienced a great many successes during this time,
			selling and renting properties for clients all over East & West Sussex.

		<p>
			Having worked for the two biggest “national style” estate agents I have learnt that maximum exposure of a
			property through effective marketing is important, however giving an exceptional face to face local service
			is paramount when going through such an exciting / stressful time in your life. Middleton Estates</br> <em
